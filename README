Experimenting with clojure to see how it handles solving the Datacenter Cooling challenge here:
    http://www.quora.com/challenges

Right now I am focusing on the logic, so the program itself does not meet all the input/output
requirements of the challenge.

The current version is brute-force - it just tries to find all the routes with no intelligence. It
is also easy to try parrallelizing the program, but right now on smaller datasets with 2 cores (my
laptop) it is faster to brute force with one thread.

How to Run

At the top of the file set these vars:

; Dimensions of the grid - make this bigger if you have more horsepower!
(def x-cells ( * 32 2))
(def y-cells ( * 48 2))

; Size in pixels of the squares we will paint on the screen - make this smaller with larger size grids
(def cell-size 5)

Then call -main with the following params:

* number of windows you want to see
