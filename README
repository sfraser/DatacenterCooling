Experimenting with clojure to see how it handles solving the Datacenter Cooling challenge here:
    http://www.quora.com/challenges

Right now I am focusing on the logic, so the program itself does not meet all the input/output
requirements of the challenge.

The current version is brute-force - it just tries to find all the routes with no intelligence. It
is also easy to try parrallelizing the program, but right now on smaller datasets with 2 cores (my
laptop) it is faster to brute force with one thread.

How to Run

At the top of the file set these vars:

; Dimensions of the grid - "width" and "height":
(def w 4)
(def h 3)

; The datacenter map as a sequence. For example here is the first challenge from
; the quora website:
(def datacenterinput '(2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1))

Then call -main:

(-main)
